Never have I ever seen Passion of Christ
Never have I ever crashed on a bike
Or been trapped on an island and had to survive
And yeah, I've been trashed a Saturday night (Yeah)
But never have I ever smoked crack from a pipe
I've never started one slow-clap in my life
I never ever sat first class on a flight
Or drank cognac from a bird bath, never tried to fly (Brrrr!)
And yeah, I'm known to cop a dub sac
But I've never have I ever rolled my own blunt wrap (That's true)
Never have I banged to Purple Rain or Dove Shack
Never have I ever loved and been loved back
Fun fact, 'cause I've had a broken heart
But I've never, ever, ever put a woman over art
And I'm never gonna start, never cheated on a chick
But ask me if I've lied, then I'll likely plead the fifth (That's my right)
Never have I seen a ghost or a spirit (Nope)
But if one appears, then I'll know when I'm near it
And if I ever fucked a prophet, I'd be quick to repent
But I've never known Jesus in the Biblical sense
(AHHH!) But I've I think we'd be friends
If he went to my school and was cool and we kicked it in chem
I've never kissed a dude (Eww); well, that's partly true
Are we counting Spin the Bottle at a cast party too?
Oh my God, so gay! Pause
Tick-tick-tick-tick, press play
I've never raved, I've never been Tased
Never maced, or been maced, or been punched in the face (Not yet)
Never have I ever contemplated suicide, or been crucified
Never have I ever mooned another driver from the side of my hooptie ride (Woop-woop!)
Never have I ever swallowed all my foolish pride
(Womp-womp) And I can't really tell
If I'm a good person or I'm faking really well (Not yet, not yet)
'Cause every now and then I'd catch her on the phone
But I never really went to visit grandma at the home
And I've always known that I won't be happy
Until I'm the best version of myself when I'm alone
So fuck thinking of marriage
Until I learn to put another person first and be a parent
I pinky-swear it


I don't know much, I
I won't know much, I
I won't know much until I
Until I know myself
I know I don't know much, I
Know I don't know much, I
Know I won't know much until I
Until I know myself
I know I don't know much, I
Know I don't know much, I
Know I won't know much until I
Until I know myself...
